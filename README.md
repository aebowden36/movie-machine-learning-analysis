# movie-machine-learning-analysis

This project consists of creating numerous webpages in order to analyze various information about movies on four streaming platforms: Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Prime Video. To view the website follow [this link](https://aebowden36.github.io/movie-machine-learning-analysis/). In total, the site has seven pages. The Home page displays the logos of the streaming platforms and two rating platforms (IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes). These images are contained within a grid that automatically adjusts and resizes according to the window size of the viewer. ![Homepage 1](https://github.com/aebowden36/movie-machine-learning-analysis/blob/main/Resources/readMeImages/homepage1.PNG) ![Homepage 2](https://github.com/aebowden36/movie-machine-learning-analysis/blob/main/Resources/readMeImages/homepage2.PNG) 

The page linked through the "Ratings" tab shows some visualizations that demonstrate how rating platforms and streaming platforms relate to one another. ![Ratings Visualizations](https://github.com/aebowden36/movie-machine-learning-analysis/blob/main/Resources/readMeImages/ratings.PNG) 

The next page, linked through the "Related Dates" tab displays a few visualizations that show the amount of movies released in the years between 1920 and 2020 on each streaming platform. ![Release Dates Visualizations](https://github.com/aebowden36/movie-machine-learning-analysis/blob/main/Resources/readMeImages/years.PNG) 

Next, the "Genres" tab holds a visualization showing the count of genres across all four platforms. ![Total Genres Chart](https://github.com/aebowden36/movie-machine-learning-analysis/blob/main/Resources/readMeImages/genre.PNG)

The "Machine Learning" tab links to a page that shows the visualizations derived from a random forest machine learning analysis predicting what genre a movie would be based on various movie features. ![Machine Learning Charts](https://github.com/aebowden36/movie-machine-learning-analysis/blob/main/Resources/readMeImages/machineLearning.png) 

The "Visualizations" tab shows a Tableau Story that holds numerous visualizations about genres of movies across streaming platforms, VADER sentimental analysis scores for ratings made by both movie critics and the general public on Rotten Tomatoes, and the number of subscribers for each platform over the past two years. The Tableau story can be seen on the website or separately through [this link](https://public.tableau.com/shared/G9Q4W7P46?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). 

Finally, the "Search for a Movie" tab allows the user to search for a movie title and it will show a synopsis of the movie, what platforms the movie is currently being hosted on, and an image of the movie poster. ![Search for a Movie](https://github.com/aebowden36/movie-machine-learning-analysis/blob/main/Resources/readMeImages/movieSearch.PNG)

The data for this project was pulled from a CSV found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney), an [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en-US) containing information about movies and TV shows on streaming platforms, and web scraping the [Rotten Tomatoes website](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/).
